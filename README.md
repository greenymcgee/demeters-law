# Demeter's Law

This site exists purely as a playground for standing up object oriented
practices using the [Law of
Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter) within a
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application using
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It currently consists of this page and
the posts page. The posts page is reaching out to an internal API that returns a
set of fixtures.

There is not a database, and there aren't any CRUD actions to speak of, but
these are things on the horizon. We'll eventually be exploring form submissions,
mutating data, user authentication, error handling, accessibility, styles, and
many more topics.
